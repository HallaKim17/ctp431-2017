The goal of this homework is designing a music visualizer that maps the audio representation or features (e.g. waveform, spectrum, energy, sub-band energy, pitch and other features) to graphical animations. Some historical backgrounds are as below:

## Step #1: Reading
- Go to the ![p5.js website](https://p5js.org/) and read the "start" and "learn" sections. Then, check out the "examples" section. 
- You can also learn more about graphics and interaction from ![the Processing website](https://processing.org/) 


## Step #2: Ideation
- You can start with our course examples (subband level meter and web-sndpeek) and modify them 
- you can map various audio features to graphical elments freely. 
- You can also add user input (e.g. keyboard or mouse) to make it more interactive 

The following examples might provide you with some inspiration:

- https://codepen.io (query with "sound visualization" or "music visualization")


## Step #3: Your visualization and deliverable
- Using web audio, canvas or p5.js, make your own music visulizer  
- If you referred to any examples or got some ideas, please cite them in the bottom of your webpage.    
- Submit your work to https://your_id.github.io/ctp431/hw2.html
- Have fun with it!
